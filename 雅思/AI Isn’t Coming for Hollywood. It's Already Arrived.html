Since 2022, the number of films and TV shows made in the United States had dropped by about 40 percent, thanks to ballooning production costs at home, competition from overseas, and long-running labor disputes everywhere. AI promised to bring the numbers back up by speeding production and slashing costs: Let computers automate the grunt work of translating dialog, adding visual effects frame by painstaking frame, and editing boom microphones out of a zillion shots. Maybe one day they could even write scripts and act! Two of the industry’s biggest unions had gone on strike in part to obtain assurances that generative AI wouldn’t replace union jobs in the near term. But every major studio and streaming service was racing to figure out its AI strategy, and a host of startups—Luma, Runway, Asteria—was working on tools to pitch them.</p></div>

                <div class="left"><p>When Emad Mostaque, a former hedge fund manager, founded Stability in 2020, the company’s mission was to “build systems that make a real difference” in solving society's toughest problems. By 2022, the system Mostaque felt he needed to build was a cloud supercomputer powerful enough to run a generative AI model. OpenAI was gaining traction with its closed-source models, and Mostaque wanted to make an open source alternative—“like Linux to Windows,” he says. He offered up the supercomputer to a group of academic researchers working on an open source system where you could type words to generate an image. The researchers weren’t going to say no. In August of that year, they launched Stable Diffusion in partnership with Mostaque’s company.</p></div>

Openness was core to the model’s success. “It allowed researchers to essentially extend the model, fine-tune it, and it spurred a whole community into action in terms of creating enhancements and add-ons,” Agrawala says. By October 2022, Stability AI had only 77 employees, but with thousands of times that many people in the wider Stable Diffusion community, it could compete with its bigger rivals. Mostaque raised $101 million in a seed round from venture capital firms and hedge funds including Coatue and Lightspeed (the final million, he tells me, was for good luck). The company was a unicorn.</p></div>

The article also claimed that Mostaque had received only a bachelor’s degree from Oxford, not a master’s. (Mostaque says that he earned both, but a clerical error on his part was responsible for the mix-up.) What’s more, Stability reportedly owed millions of dollars to Amazon Web Services, which provided the computing power for its model. Though Mostaque had spoken of a partnership, Stability’s spokesperson acknowledged to Forbes that it was in fact a run-of-the-mill cloud services agreement with a standard discount.</p></div>

Four months after the article came out, VCs from both Coatue and Lightspeed left the board of directors, signaling they no longer had faith in the business. By the end of the year, the company’s head of research, chief operating officer, general counsel, and head of human resources had left as well. Many of Stability’s prominent researchers would follow. Under pressure from investors, Mostaque finally left the company on March 22, 2024—just a few weeks after Lady Gaga’s greenhouse soiree.</p></div>

That September, another startup, Runway, signed the AI industry’s first big deal with a movie studio. Runway would get access to Lionsgate’s proprietary catalog of movies as training data and develop tools for the studio. “The time it takes to go from idea to execution is just shrinking—like a lot,” says Cristóbal Valenzuela, CEO of Runway. “You can do things in just a couple of minutes that used to take two weeks.” In the coming years, he predicts, “you will have teams of two, three, four people making the work that used to require armies and hundreds of millions of dollars.”</p></div>

What’s doubly surprising, though, is that Cameron is on the board of an AI company run by Parker and Akkaraju. A decade ago, Cameron was helping lead Hollywood’s charge against them. He didn’t appreciate the premise of their streaming platform, the Screening Room, which let people watch new releases at home for $50 on the same day they came out in theaters. Cameron reportedly told a crowd at CinemaCon that he was “committed to the theater experience.” In the years that followed, none of the major studios publicly announced deals with the Screening Room, and in 2020 the company rebranded as SR Labs.</p></div>

Text-to-image generators might work for marketing agencies, but they often lack the quality required for a feature film. “I worked on one film for Netflix and tried to use a single shot,” says a filmmaker who asked to remain anonymous, not wanting to discuss their use of AI publicly. The AI-generated footage got “bounced back” from quality control because it wasn’t 4K resolution, the filmmaker says.</p></div>

The process can create new inefficiencies. “The inefficiency in the old system was really the information gap between what I see and what I imagine I want moving forward,” says Luisa Huang, cofounder of Toonstar, a tech-forward animation company. “With AI, the inefficiency becomes ‘Here's a version, here's another version, here's another version.’”</p></div>
